 * @param[in] wt		The TextEdit structure to initialise. If this is NULL, the structure is dynamically allocated.
 * @param[in] pInit		The initialisation parameters to use.
 * @param[in] maxSize	The maximum number of characters the TextEdit widget can hold. (0 means unlimited).
 *
 * @return				NULL if there is no resultant drawing area, otherwise the widget handle.
 *
 * @note				If the initial text set is larger than maxSize then the text is truncated at maxSize characters.
