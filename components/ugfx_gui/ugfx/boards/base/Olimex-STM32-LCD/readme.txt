This directory contains the interface for the Olimex-STM32-LCD board
running ChibiOS/RT.

As this is not a standard ChibiOS/RT supported board, the necessary board files have
also been provided in the chibios_board directory 

If you are using the uGFX makefiles use OPT_CPU=stm32m3 in your makefile to get the correct cpu.
